# Public Health 390e NHANES data for group project  
Here you will find the information you need to conduct your analyses. Following is a list of steps to help you use this data:  
  
1. Each group should download the csv file for their group (e.g., group1.csv)  
  
2. The data for groups come from different years of analysis (based on variable availability). Specifically:  
  2.1. NHANES 2013-2014 data: Group 1 and Group 6  
  2.2. NHANES 2015-2016 data: Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, and Group 5  
  2.3. NHANES 2017-2018 data: Group 7 and Instructors  
  
3. You should download the csv file with the confounders for the year of your data (e.g., Group 5 would download confounders2015.csv)  
  
4. You will have to join these tables.  
  
5. How do I know what the variables mean? Here are the codebooks:
