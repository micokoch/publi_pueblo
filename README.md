# Public Health 390e NHANES data for group project
Here you will find the information you need to conduct your analyses. Following is a list of steps to help you use this data:

1. Each group should download the csv file for their group (e.g., group1.csv).
2. The data for groups come from different years of analysis (based on variable availability). Specifically:
  2.1. NHANES 2013-2014 data: Group 1 and Group 6
  2.2. NHANES 2015-2016 data: Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, and Group 5
  2.3. NHANES 2017-2018 data: Group 7 and Instructors
3. You should download the csv file with the confounders for the year of your data (e.g., Group 5 would download confounders2015.csv)
4. You will have to join these tables.
5. How do I know what the variables mean? Here are the codebooks:
  5.1. Group 1:
    Exposure: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/UPHOPM_H.htm
    Outcome: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DPQ_H.htm
  7.2. Group 2:
  8.3. Group 3:
  9.4. Group 4:
  10.5. Group 5:
  11.6. Group 6:
  12.7. Group 7:

Some addtional notes:
1. How do I know what the variables mean?
  1.1. You can copy the variable name, add NHANES, the year, and paste it into Google. The first search item will probably be the codebook, which will give you a description for many variables. I will give 2 examples:
    1.1.1. Group 4: I pick their third variable (
